# CVE-2025-64064 – Privilege escalation to Administrator

### Vulnerability description
Primakon Pi Portal 1.0.18 /api/v2/pp_users endpoint fails to adequately check user permissions before processing a PATCH request to modify the PP_SECURITY_PROFILE_ID. Because of weak access controls any low level user can use this API and change their permission to Administrator by using PP_SECURITY_PROFILE_ID=2 inside body of request and escalate privileges.
