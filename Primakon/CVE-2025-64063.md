# CVE-2025-64063 – Broken Access Control on multiple API endpoints

### Vulnerability description
Primakon Pi Portal 1.0.18 API endpoints fail to enforce sufficient authorization checks when processing requests. Specifically, a low level user can exploit this flaw by sending direct HTTP requests to administrative endpoints, bypassing the UI restrictions. 
This allows the attacker to manipulate data outside their assigned scope, including: 
1. Unauthorized Account modification - modifying/deleting arbitrary user accounts and changing passwords by sending a direct request to the user management API endpoint
2. Confidential Data Access - accessing and downloading sensitive organizational documents via a direct request to the document retrieval API
3. Privilege escalation
