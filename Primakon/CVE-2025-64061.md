# CVE-2025-64061 - Excessive data exposure

### Vulnerability description
Primakon Pi Portal 1.0.18 /api/v2/users endpoint is vulnerable to unauthorized data exposure due to deficient access control mechanisms. Any authenticated user, regardless of their privilege level (including standard or low-privileged users), can make a GET request to this endpoint and retrieve a complete, unfiltered list of all registered application users. Crucially, the API response body for this endpoint includes password hashes.
